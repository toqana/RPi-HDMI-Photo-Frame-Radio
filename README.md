# Raspberry Pi Full HD HDMI Photo Frame Carousel with SDR Radio and Internet Radio

### Description

This is a verified and fully functional engineering software and hardware prototype of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ Full HD (1920x1080) photo frame with both Software Defined Radio ("SDR") and Internet Radio audio. The photo carousel and audio play through the HDMI port.

As an engineering prototype, there are important and necessary functions that need to be added to make this a finished consumer product, such as security hardening and adding a consumer friendly control panel.

The SDR Radio is based on the "NooElec RTL-SDR, FM+DAB, DVB-T USB Stick Set with RTL2832U & R820T" that is available from Amazon for $19.95.

The RPi runs Raspbian Stretch, and the application is written in Python 2.7. The web based user control panel is implemented using the Python Flask webserver running on port 80, which requires the root user. If you do not wish to run the Python application as root, then please change the Flask webserver port.

The HDMI display (i.e. photos and text) is generated in Python using SDL2. New photos are loaded into "inFolder", which are then automatically resized to an aspect ratio correct maximum size of 1920x1080 (if required), and then loaded into "displayFolder".

The SDR HDMI audio is generated by piping the SDR binary to the pulseaudio "aplay" program. This runs as a Python subprocess that can be terminated when the audio source is changed.

The Internet Radio HDMI audio is generated by using "cvlc" (i.e. the command line VLC program) with the Internet Radio stream URL. This runs as a Python subprocess that can be terminated when the audio source is changed.

The Python Flask webserver uses AJAX to receive commands from one or more control panel browsers, and websockets to send synchronized information to one or more control panel browsers (e.g. the control panel URL, audio source in use, date, and time).
